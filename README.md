After the reading the assessment document, I took to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/7dxGrvCtyerBBwUc423XTW?node-id=0-1&node-type=CANVAS&t=PulYUqLaR15tTGxk-0&type=design&mode=design) and created the screens
to create the screens based on my understanding, adhering to industry-standard UI and UX practices.

I then initiated an empty React Native project with TypeScript and set up Jest for testing. 
After importing and linking all assets with npx react-native-assets, 
I focused on creating reusable components and helper functions.

ensured that all the tools mentioned in the assessment file were utilized.
